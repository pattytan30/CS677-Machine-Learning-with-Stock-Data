# CS677-Machine-Learning-with-Stock-Data

This profile contains my homeworks for the course CS677. I applied mulitple machine learning algorithms into stock data analytics. The stock I chosed is TSLA. I assigned label, either green or red, for each week. In most of cases, I used 2018 stock data to train and tested the accuracy with 2019 data.
